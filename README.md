A two-headed demo of a few of our favorite open-source and cloud software tools.

"Flow" is a Java/Spring/Spring Integration program that reads scientific data and sends to either a local 
MongoDB instance, or to the "watergraph" program on Google App Engine.

"Watergraph" accepts and stores that scientific data and provides a few simple ways to access it; the program
is written in Python and uses the Google storage engine.
